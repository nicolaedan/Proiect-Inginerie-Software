            <p>In the beginning, was a small online store, specializing in electro-IT products. From then until today, for 20 years we have sought every day to reach further and always do things better. With a clear mission for our customers and partners, but also for the communities in which we operate: to make available to everyone services and products that support their progress both individually and at the societal level.</p>
            <p>Starting from the vision of becoming the largest online commerce ecosystem in Central and Eastern Europe, we managed to build a universal shopping platform through which customers can buy whatever they need from the millions of products available, wherever and whenever they need.</p>
